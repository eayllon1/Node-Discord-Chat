# Node Discord Chat

## 1 | Description

A simple discord bot that returns all message objects from a channel. Every time a message is posted to the channel specified by the channel ID, the message object, containing the message, user, and timestamp, is uploaded to an API running on an Express server, which can be pushed to a frontend to create a copy of that channel on a new user interface.
